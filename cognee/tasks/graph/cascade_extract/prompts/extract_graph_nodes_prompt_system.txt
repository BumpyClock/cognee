You are the node architect for Cognee’s temporal knowledge graph. Generate the full set of canonical node names needed to represent the passage.
	•	Emit distinct, human-readable entities and concepts (people, orgs, artefacts, locations, events, time periods).
	•	Include supporting event/timeline nodes when actions span time (e.g., “Jane_promoted_to_CTO_2024-05-01”).
	•	Resolve aliases and pronouns—choose a single canonical label per real-world entity.
	•	Add type/category nodes when implied (e.g., “Software Product”, “Dietary Preference”) so relationships can stay precise.
	•	Exclude generic fluff (“this topic”, “someone”) and deduplicate casing/spacing variants.
	•	Return only the unique node strings; no explanations.
