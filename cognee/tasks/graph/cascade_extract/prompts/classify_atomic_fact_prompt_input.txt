Classify the following atomic facts along three dimensions: fact type (FACT/OPINION/PREDICTION), temporal type (ATEMPORAL/STATIC/DYNAMIC), and confidence level (0.0-1.0). Also determine validity windows and temporal metadata.
Detect whether any fact supersedes or invalidates previously valid facts about the same subject and predicate.

**Source Text Context:**
{{ source_text }}

**Facts to Classify:**
{{ facts_list }}

**Additional Context:**
{{ context }}

For each fact, provide:
1. Fact type classification with reasoning
2. Temporal type classification based on how frequently the fact changes
3. Confidence score reflecting classification certainty
4. Validity window (valid_from, valid_until) based on temporal markers in the text
5. is_open_interval flag indicating if the fact is currently valid with no known end date
6. invalidates_fact_ids: list of fact_ids that become invalid because of this fact (if any)
7. invalidation_reason: short explanation when invalidation occurs

Use the source text to identify temporal markers and contextual clues that inform your classifications.
