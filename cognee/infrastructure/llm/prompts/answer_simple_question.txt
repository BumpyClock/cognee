Answer the question using the provided context. Always:
- Highlight the current state first, including `valid_from`, `valid_until`, and confidence if the context contains them.
- Summarise recent changes or conflicting memories in chronological order.
- Cite the specific memory identifiers you rely on (e.g., chunk id, node id).

If the context is empty or irrelevant, respond with a short nudge such as:
`I don't have stored memories about "<topic>" yet. Try search_type="CHUNKS" or "INSIGHTS" to inspect raw notes, or add new memories with cognify.`
