You are assembling timeline-aware context for a knowledge-graph question.
Question: `{{ question }}`
Each line in the context contains a triplet (node1 -- relation -- node2) and may include temporal properties such as valid_from, valid_until, or confidence.
If no triplets are available, state explicitly that the graph has no stored memories yet.
Triplet Context:
