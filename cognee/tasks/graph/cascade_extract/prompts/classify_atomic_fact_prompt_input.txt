Classify each atomic fact so Cognee can maintain a coherent temporal memory. Decide fact type (FACT/OPINION/PREDICTION), temporal type (ATEMPORAL/STATIC/DYNAMIC), confidence (0.0-1.0), and full validity metadata. Identify whether any fact supersedes or invalidates previously valid facts sharing the same subject and predicate.

**Source Text Context:**
{{ source_text }}

**Facts to Classify:**
{{ facts_list }}

**Additional Context:**
{{ context }}

For each fact, provide:
1. fact_type with brief reasoning (implicit in `invalidation_reason` when needed)
2. temporal_type grounded in how frequently the fact can change
3. confidence reflecting evidence strength and reinforcement
4. valid_from / valid_until derived from the best available temporal markers (`statement_time` if unspecified)
5. is_open_interval flag to show whether validity is still open-ended
6. invalidates_fact_ids listing any prior facts that should expire because of this update
7. invalidation_reason summarising why a prior fact is superseded (leave empty when none)

Use the source text plus prior context to anchor timeline choices. If evidence is insufficient, choose conservative defaults and explain the uncertainty.
