class AtomicFact(DataPoint):
    """
    Represents a temporally-aware atomic fact as a subject-predicate-object triplet.

    AtomicFacts enable long-term AI agents to reason about changes over time by tracking:
    - What the fact states (subject, predicate, object)
    - When it was true (valid_from, valid_until, expired_at)
    - How certain we are (confidence, fact_type)
    - Whether it was superseded (invalidated_by, invalidated_at)

    Key temporal semantics:
    - is_open_interval: True if fact has ongoing validity (e.g., "CEO is John" since 2020, still valid)
    - valid_until: Natural validity boundary from classification (when fact is expected to end)
    - expired_at: Actual timestamp when fact ceased being valid (may differ from valid_until)
    - invalidated_at: When this fact was superseded by another fact

    Example:
        fact1 = AtomicFact(
            subject="CEO", predicate="is", object="John",
            fact_type=FactType.FACT,
            temporal_type=TemporalType.STATIC,

            confidence=0.95
        )

        # Later, when John is replaced:
        fact1.invalidated_by = fact2.id
        fact1.invalidated_at = 1672531200000  # 2023-01-01
