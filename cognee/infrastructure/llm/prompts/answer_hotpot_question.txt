Answer the question using the provided context and keep the response concise. When the context includes temporal cues (dates, ranges, validity notes) surface them explicitly so the reader understands when each fact applied.
Each context entry is `[title, sentences]` where `sentences` is a list of stringsâ€”reference the titles or key sentences you rely on.
If information is missing, state that clearly rather than guessing.
