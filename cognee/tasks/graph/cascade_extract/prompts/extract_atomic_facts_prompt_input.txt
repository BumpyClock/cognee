Extract atomic facts from the following text so that downstream temporal agents can reason about timelines, contradictions, and provenance. Break every statement into the smallest truthful (subject, predicate, object) triplets. This is round {{ round_number }} of {{ total_rounds }}.

**Text:**
{{ text }}

**Previously Extracted Facts:**
{{ previous_facts }}

Identify all atomic facts in the text, resolving pronouns and implicit references. Each fact should stand alone, include temporal cues, and (when relevant) mention any contradictions with previously seen `fact_id`s inside `supporting_text`.

Return a JSON array. For each fact include:
- `fact_id`: stable snake_case identifier derived from subject+predicate+object (reuse existing IDs when refining).
- `subject`, `predicate`, `object`: strings capturing the atomic statement.
- `supporting_text`: the exact sentence or clause from the source.
- `observed_at`: ISO date if present in the text, otherwise `"unknown"`.
- `source_offset`: start and end character indices if provided, else `"unknown"`.

If you discover no new atomic facts that add meaning beyond `previous_facts`, return an empty array `[]`.
