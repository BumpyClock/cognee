Extract atomic facts from the following text, breaking down complex sentences into simple (subject, predicate, object) triplets. Build upon previously extracted facts to ensure consistency and avoid duplication. This is round {{ round_number }} of {{ total_rounds }}.

**Text:**
{{ text }}

**Previously Extracted Facts:**
{{ previous_facts }}

Identify all atomic facts in the text, resolving pronouns and implicit references. Each fact should be a distinct, simple statement that can stand alone.

Return a JSON array. For each fact include:
- `fact_id`: stable snake_case identifier derived from subject+predicate+object (reuse existing IDs when refining).
- `subject`, `predicate`, `object`: strings capturing the atomic statement.
- `supporting_text`: the exact sentence or clause from the source.
- `observed_at`: ISO date if present in the text, otherwise `"unknown"`.
- `source_offset`: start and end character indices if provided, else `"unknown"`.

If no new atomic facts are found, return an empty array `[]`.
